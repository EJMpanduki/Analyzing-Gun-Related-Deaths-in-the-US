# Analyzing-Gun-Related-Deaths-in-the-US
This is a personal project where I explore a data set on gun-related deaths in the US between 2012 and 2014 using python. I chose to additionally add some tableau charts to aid in the analysis however future projects will make use of python visualizations.
### Topics Explored:
- Gun Related Death totals by year.
- Gun Related Death totals by month.
- Gun Related Death totals by sex.
- Gun Related Death totals by race, which is expanded upon to look at per-capita rates as well as per-capita homicide rates.
