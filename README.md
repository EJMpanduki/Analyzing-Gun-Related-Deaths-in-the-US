# Analyzing-Gun-Related-Deaths-in-the-US
This is a personal project where I explore a data set on gun-related deaths in the US between 2012 and 2014 using python. This is my first project and there are no particularly sophisticated tools used in it. Just mostly familiarizing myself with some basic python. I chose to additionally add some tableau charts to aid in the analysis however future projects will make use of python visualizations.
### Topics Explored:
- Gun Related Death totals by year.
- Gun Related Death totals by month.
- Gun Related Death totals by sex.
- Gun Related Death totals by race, which is expanded upon to look at per-capita rates as well as per-capita homicide rates.
